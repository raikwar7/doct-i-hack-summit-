# 🩺 Disease Prediction & Doctor Recommendation Web App

This web application predicts the **top 7 possible diseases** based on a combination of user-provided symptoms using a **Random Forest model**. The app also provides:

✅ Detailed **disease descriptions**\
✅ Suggested **precautions** to follow\
✅ Recommended **doctors** based on location, ratings, and experience using a **weighted scoring model**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Predict Top 7 Diseases**: Enter symptoms, and the app predicts the most likely diseases with their probabilities.\
✅ **Disease Description & Precautions**: Displays important information about predicted diseases.\
✅ **Doctor Recommendation System**: Based on user-selected disease and location, the app suggests top-rated doctors using a **weighted average model** that considers **ratings** and **experience** (further scaled and normalized for accuracy).\
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** for seamless navigation and interaction.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Disease Prediction Flow:**

   - Users enter their symptoms in the provided input fields.
   - The **Random Forest model** predicts the **top 7 possible diseases** with their probabilities.
   - The app retrieves relevant **descriptions** and **precautions** from the dataset.

2. **Doctor Recommendation Flow:**

   - Users can choose to find doctors for their predicted disease.
   - Users provide their **preferred location** as input.
   - The system uses a **weighted average model** that prioritizes:
     - **Doctor Ratings** (80%)
     - **Years of Experience** (20%)
   - The scores are **scaled** and **normalized** to ensure fair ranking.
